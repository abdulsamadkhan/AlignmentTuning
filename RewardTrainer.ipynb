        "# Reward Modeling using `trl` library\n",
        "In this tutorial, you'll step into the role of a machine learning engineer at a large tech company. Your goal is to integrate a powerful large language model (LLM) into AI-driven products that require understanding complex instructions, generating high-quality responses, and improving automated customer support.\n",
        "\n",
        "But choosing an off-the-shelf LLM isn’t enough. To make it truly effective, you'll need to fine-tune it so that it not only performs well technically but also aligns with your company’s values and objectives. That’s where reward models come in.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this hands-on walkthrough, you’ll learn how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Set up your development environment for training reward models using the trl library from Hugging Face.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Define custom reward functions that reflect the behaviors and priorities your LLM should follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Train a reward model to score outputs based on these preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune the LLM so it consistently produces better, more aligned responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand how to guide LLM behavior with reward models and apply these techniques to real-world AI applications. Let’s get started!"

To handle padding, set the `pad_token` of the tokenizer to be the same as the `eos_token` (end-of-sequence token). Similarly, configure the model to use the `eos_token_id` as the `pad_token_id`.

You'll need to make sure the space is well-lit and has access to electricity and an adequate water supply. Next, you'll need to choose the type of hydroponic system you want to use. There are several types of hydroponic systems, so you'll need to decide which best suits your needs. Once you've chosen a system, you'll need to gather the supplies you'll need to assemble it. This includes things like pumps, growing trays, grow lights, and nutrients. Once you've assembled the system, you'll need to add your choice of herbs to the system. Lastly, you'll need to monitor and adjust the system as needed to ensure your herbs are getting the correct amount of light, water, and nutrients.\n",

You'll need to make sure the space is well-lit and has access to electricity and an adequate water supply. Next, you'll need to choose the type of hydroponic system you want to use. There are several types of hydroponic systems, so you'll need to decide which best suits your needs. Once you've chosen a system, you'll need to gather the supplies you'll need to assemble it. This includes things like pumps, growing trays, grow lights, and nutrients. Once you've assembled the system, you'll need to add your choice of herbs to the system. Lastly, you'll need to monitor and adjust the system as needed to ensure your herbs are getting the correct amount of light, water, and nutrients.\n"

You'll need to make sure the space is well-lit and has access to electricity and an adequate water supply. Next, you'll need to choose the type of hydroponic system you want to use. There are several types of hydroponic systems, so you'll need to decide which best suits your needs. Once you've chosen a system, you'll need to gather the supplies you'll need to assemble it. This includes things like pumps, growing trays, grow lights, and nutrients. Once you've assembled the system, you'll need to add your choice of herbs to the system. Lastly, you'll need to monitor and adjust the system as needed to ensure your herbs are getting the correct amount of light, water, and nutrients. 7.002030849456787\n",

            "Assistant: The moon's orbit around Earth is an elliptical path that takes approximately 27.3 days to complete. As it orbits, the moon's distance from Earth varies over the course of its orbit from its closest point, known as the perigee, to its furthest point, known as the apogee. During this time, the moon is constantly being pulled toward Earth by its gravitational force, which affects its movement and the shape of its orbit. This same force is also responsible for the tidal forces experienced on Earth and causes the tidal bulge to rise and fall around the planet.\n",

Having said that, it can also be a significant stress of having a roommate, because you’re not really in control of a other person’s schedule, you’re basically just a small cot in a person’s bed. score: 4.678934574127197\n",

You can also group items by type, style, color, or season to make it easier to find what you need when you need it. Additionally, you can use hangers with clips to hang clothing that won't stay put on flimsy hangers. Finally, taking care to fold clothing neatly and store off-season items in labelled boxes or bins can help you organize your closet in an efficient and attractive way. score: 6.609783172607422\n",

The laws of quantum mechanics state that light behaves both as a wave and as a particle, depending on how it is observed. This is known as the wavelike nature of light, which has been verified by multiple scientific experiments. Since light is a form of energy, it is affected by the forces of nature, such as gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.

            "\n",
            "Assistant: One way to keep track of multiple bills and payments is to create a spreadsheet or budgeting software where you can enter in all of your bills, due dates, and payments. You can also set up reminders so that you receive notifications about upcoming payments. Additionally, many banks offer online banking services that can also help you keep track of multiple bills and payments. Finally, you can set up automatic payments from your bank account to pay bills on time. score: 7.14103889465332\n",

If you have a car, the driving distance in your local area would be about 200 miles out-of-town, and you would have to pay for a gas station along the way, while your child would have to walk at least a block, from school to the station to get a fuel, and in the evenings you might have to drive to a other neighborhood to get food. score: 6.840384483337402\n",

To make a treehouse from cardboard, you’d need to glue cardboard around the edges of the structure. The cardboard might be very thin and the wood, thin-calked. Conventional treehouses are made from tree trunks around 20-24 feet in diameter. To build a treehouse from cardboard, you'd need to glue wood around the edges of the structure, or even carefully fold the structure flat against another wall. Trees that don’t have much mass tend to become brittle when grown, so to keep a treehouse in good condition, the tree itself may still need to be re-soded when it grows back into its original condition. score: 6.666253089904785\n",

            "Assistant: Real estate investing is essentially the purchase and ownership of property either for rental income or as a long-term investment. You could purchase a property outright and earn income through rental payments, or you could make short-term investments by flipping a property for profits upon reselling it. You can also invest in real estate through investments like REITs which allow you to pool your money to invest in large-scale real estate projects. In terms of the basics, it is important to do your research and understand the local market before making any investments.

            "Assistant: I think there are a couple of different factors that come into play here. The first is how much material costs, and how much of the material is usable. A house has a lot of walls, so that's a very important factor. Plus, how much space is needed for a house, and how much of it an individual living room, office, bathroom, etc. A home has lots of other stuff too, like furniture, furniture, art, etc. This is quite a complex issue that I should try to understand. But if that were the case, I would say that there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages to various types of housing. Of course there are lots of factors that aren't listed on Wikipedia, so I will give you my educated guesses. score: 5.487583160400391\n",
